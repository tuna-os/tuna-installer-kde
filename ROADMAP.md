# TunaOS KDE Installer — Roadmap

**Last updated**: 2026-08-29 | **Maintainer**: tuna-os (hanthor)

## Mission

Ship the KDE desktop's install experience: a thin Qt 6 / Kirigami wizard
(built the way KDE's own KISS initial-setup is built — self-contained
`SetupModule` steps) that drives the fisherman bootc backend, so a first-time
Plasma user gets a native install from first boot to desktop.

---

## Current Status

- **App**: Qt 6 / Kirigami (Plasma 6) frontend for fisherman — modular
  steps under `modules/<name>/contents/ui/main.qml`; CI-rendered walkthrough
  in docs/gui-walkthrough.md.
- **Distribution**: image-baked flatpak (`org.tunaos.InstallerKde`) — no
  standalone GitHub Releases (by design, not yet documented as policy).
- **Parity**: covered by `installer-smoke.yml` + `docs/INSTALLER-FRONTENDS.md`
  checks (readiness stamp, non-blank, advances, per-screen OCR).
- **Health**: active (pushed 08-29); install-recipe secrets handling shipped in
  #35, backend coverage from #29 was extended in #42, and the unpinned
  privileged backend (#33) remains open.

### Priorities

| P1 | Backend test coverage preserved | #29/#42 | ✅ Complete |
| P2 | ROADMAP-coverage entry in org ROADMAP tally | #1295 | ⬜ Not started |
